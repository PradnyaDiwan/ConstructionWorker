# ConstructionWorker
Example for static variable


Dolphin Heights is a 12 storied building that is under construction.Alex  is a Civil Engineer cum Mason for the apartment. He is the Manager for 300 construction workers and pays their daily wages equally for every work. construction workers has to compulsory give their bank account details i.e accountnumber ,fullname ,bankname,IFSC code,adharcardno and phonenumber  while joining the work for the payment.Calculate total amount given to workers for slab construction by Alex.

Case 1:
Alex gathered 8  construction workers for the slabs construction and initially he deposited an advance amount, ₹500 each. workers  started working and completed the slabs in 10 days. Here create a method called, addingAdvanceAmount() which adds ₹500 to account.


Case 2:
According to Alex , the daily wage he declared is ₹1500 (including the advance amount) i.e., per day. Construct a function named, calculateTotalAmountForAllworkers() which calculates the wages received by a workers after finishing all slabs i.e., print the amount given to all  workers for slab construction.


Solution Hint:
Variables can be like:
final accountNumber;
String labourerName;
Static totalAmountForSlabConstruction ; 

calculateTotalAmountForAllworkers()
// Function needs to calculate the total account balance of a labourer after 10 days. So here the static variable needs to be changed as the wages get added to the account of the labourer..
